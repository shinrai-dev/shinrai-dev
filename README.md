<b> Welcome to the ShinrAI GitHub Repository!</b>

At ShinrAI, we recognize that maintaining a unified codebase is no small feat. However, we are committed to ensuring that every visitor to this hub can seamlessly explore and interact with the folder structure and the code it contains.

To foster clarity and efficiency, we strongly encourage all new development efforts to adhere to the recommended folder structure outlined below. Moreover, we urge existing projects to align with this structure, wherever feasible, to promote consistency and ease of navigation across our repositories.

By working together, we can create a streamlined and intuitive development environment for everyone.

- 👋 <i><b>dep</b></i>: A dep Folder that has the directory of your stored dependencies. 
- 👀 <i><b>doc</b></i>: A doc Folder containing your documentation.
- 🌱 <i><b>res</b></i>: A res Folder for all your project’s static resources, such as images. 
- 💞️ <i><b>samples</b></i>: A samples Folder that provides “Hello World” & Co style code supporting the documentation. 
- 📫 <i><b>src</b></i>: An src Folder for your source code (except if you use languages that use headers or if you have an application framework).
- 😄 <i><b>test</b></i>: A test Folder to store your integration, unit, and other tests. 
- 🕷️ <i><b>data</b></i>: A data Folder to store any datasets or other relevant external data used by your project. This folder typically contains files like .csv, .json, or other data formats necessary for your project.
- 🦎 <i><b>output</b></i>: An output Folder where the results of the build process or other computational outputs are stored. This folder often includes compiled binaries, logs, or generated artifacts.
- 🪼 <i><b>notebooks</b></i>: A notebooks Folder for storing Jupyter notebooks or other interactive documents related to data analysis, experimentation, or documentation of processes used in the project.
